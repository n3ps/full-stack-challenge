# Full-stack challenge
*"Design a web application that allows employees to submit feedback toward each other's performance review"*

---

## Getting started

The only prerequisite is Node (6.12 or higher)

### Server
- Change to the `server` directory
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm start` to run the the server at http://localhost:3001

### Client
- Change to the `client` directory
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm start` to build the React project and open http://localhost:3000 in a new browser window


## Design decisions
Due to time contraints, several features have not been implemented (yet) and there is no persistent data store. The source is marked with a lot of "todo's" that I hope to revisit when time permits.
